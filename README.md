# RAproject_01

##The Data folder contains versions of data that I will simulate by each week. For eg. df_01 is the dataset prepared in the first week. df_02 is the data prepared in the second week of this sem.


##The Code folder also contains versions of code files. For eg. Simulation_01.R is the code file for the first week, Simulation_01.R is for the second week.


#This is to keep record of the changes made every week, in the dataset and codes.


#Week 5
Data folder contains the baseline data and code folder contains 'Simulation_05' which is a stand-alone code file now used to generate the baseline data.
