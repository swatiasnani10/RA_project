# RAproject_01

##The Data folder contains versions of data that I will simulate by each week. For eg. df_01 is the dataset prepared in the first week. df_02 is the data prepared in the second week of this sem.


##The Code folder also contains versions of code files. For eg. Simulation_01.R is the code file for the first week, Simulation_01.R is for the second week.


#This is to keep record of the changes made every week, in the dataset and codes.


#Week 5
Data folder contains the baseline data and code folder contains 'Simulation_05' which is a stand-alone code file now used to generate the baseline data.

#20200407 Update
Changes in the baseline data through code file 'Simulation_06':
1) Number of patients assigned to PCPs increase: Changed the parameter range.
2) Market shares of specialists of a particular PCP look skewed/concentrated: Generate a function for market shares.
3) Treatment outcomes not 0 for more than 50 percent of the patients, if the specialist is of very high quality: Changed the way I previously defined treatment outcomes.
